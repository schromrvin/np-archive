1. Interactive Timeline (Immersive Historical Entry Point)

The timeline serves as the main narrative gateway into NP’s heritage. Instead of static text blocks and simple scrolling, it uses parallax motion, layered imagery, and subtle animations to create a cinematic, story-driven experience. As users scroll, archival photographs, captions, and key milestones fade, scale, and transition into view, allowing history to unfold spatially rather than as a list of dates. Visuals take priority over dense text, supported by short contextual descriptions that anchor each era. This transforms heritage from something to “read” into something to “enter”, drawing users emotionally into the founding years, growth phases, and defining moments of the institution.

2. Explore (Virtual Spaces with Past–Present Comparison)

The Explore feature reinterprets the heritage map as an interactive discovery layer rather than a functional navigation tool. Users access a 360-degree campus view with clickable pins placed at historically significant locations. Selecting a pin opens a focused modal experience where a past–present slider reveals how the space has evolved over time, supported by archival images and concise storytelling. Instead of passively viewing history in a gallery, users actively uncover it through spatial exploration. This hands-on interaction allows heritage to be understood through place, showing how everyday environments such as blocks, canteens, or landmarks carry layered histories and meaning.

3. NP Chatbot (Conversational Heritage Guide)*

The NP Chatbot acts as an always-available digital guide embedded across the portal. It allows users to ask questions about NP’s history, milestones, fun facts, and campus evolution in natural language. Beyond information retrieval, it supports guided exploration by recommending related timeline eras, virtual spaces, or memory stories based on user queries. The chatbot lowers the barrier to engagement by turning heritage discovery into a conversational, on-demand experience, enabling users to learn at their own pace and follow personal curiosities rather than fixed content paths.

4. Scavenger Hunt (Gamified Physical-Digital Bridge)

The Scavenger Hunt transforms heritage exploration into a time-bound, social, and event-based experience. Designed to run during key moments such as NP Day, Orientation, or Open House, it bridges digital storytelling with physical campus movement. By guiding participants through historically meaningful locations and rewarding discovery through quizzes, challenges, and progression, heritage becomes a shared activity rather than a solitary one. The feature introduces play, competition, and collective participation, positioning history as something to be experienced together in real spaces.

5. Memory Hub (Community-Driven Living Archive)

The Memory Wall shifts the narrative from institution-centred to people-centred by allowing students, staff, and alumni to contribute their own moments, reflections, and media. Displayed both digitally and on a physical touchscreen installation, memories appear as interactive cards that can be browsed, flipped, and revisited over time. This creates a continuously evolving layer of lived experience that sits alongside official milestones. By preserving everyday stories and emotional moments, the Memory Wall turns heritage into a shared, intergenerational archive and positions the community as co-authors of NP’s ongoing story rather than passive observers.
